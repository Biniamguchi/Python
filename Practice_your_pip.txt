pip install Django: installs a package called Flask.

-e, --editable

pip install Django (We know you already ran this one. What information do you see returned in terminal after this command?)
Collection Django
   Using Django-1.11.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl
 ...
Sucessfully install Django-1.11.5

pip freeze (What's the difference between freeze and list?)
pip freeze: Output installed packages in requirements format.
click==6.7
pip list: just list installed packages.
click(6.7)
in other words there are two differences:

1. Output format, freeze gives us the standard requirement format that may be used later with pip install -r to install requirements from.
2. Output content, pip list include editables which pip freeze does not.

First cd into your Desktop directory (cd ~/Desktop), then run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt. What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file?

pip show Django: Show information about one or more installed packages.Here it shows the name,version,summary etc,about django.
